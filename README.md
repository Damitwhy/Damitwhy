## Hi there 👋
I am Ken, living in England, I've trained to be a full stack web-developer with Code Institute, having just recently graduated from Code Institutes 16 week Full Stack Program.
The course has provided me with the basics in:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Java Script
 - Python
 - Django
 - Agile methodology
 - UX/UI design concepts
 - Git and GitHub
 - GitPod and VS Code IDE's
 - BootStrap 5
   
Here are some stats that may be relevent.

# So Here I Am!

Since joining the Code Institute’s Program, I’ve started to learn about the applications that are available for Web Developers, GitHub being one of the many.

I will pursue this as best I can, perhaps becoming good enough to build sites for local community groups who don’t have the funds or the know-how to produce their own.

I’ve seen lots of Gmail business addresses that don’t have a website devoted to their business/charitable organisation. I find it strange - why don’t they have websites of their own? Maybe I should drop them an email to offer a Business Site. 🙊 I had thought about buying up domain names before offering service, but that could be really costly 🙉 if I got no interest. However, I recently learned that there was a study done that asked a question such as, “If you were thinking about buying a new car or upgrading, what car would you buy?” It was found that those people asked were twice as likely to actually buy a new car within the next year than those not asked the same question. So maybe popping the question might be enough to get business from potential customers.

Well wish me luck as I wish you the very best in your endeavours. 🤟
